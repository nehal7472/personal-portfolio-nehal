      I have strong expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose. I not only work with these technologies but also focus on following best practices to deliver clean, efficient, and high-quality results. Throughout my journey, Iâ€™ve used these skills to build a variety of portfolio projects, gaining hands-on experience with responsive design, REST APIs, authentication, and role-based access control, while also using tools like Git, GitHub, VS Code, and Postman to streamline my workflow.
